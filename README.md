# Optical Tracking Sensor Board

## Feature
  * An optical tracking sensor board using PAT9125EL-TKIT manufactured by PixArt Imaging.  
  * It is possible to detect two-dimensional movement with one sensor.  
  * It can detect object movement at a distance of 1 to 30 mm.
  * No additional lens is required.  
  * Programmable resolution up to 1,275cpi.  
  * It can be easily connected via I2C (Grove compatible connector).  
  * This board is equipped with voltage level conversion, so it can be directly connected to 5V systems such as Arduino Uno.  

## Application
  * Tracking on a Moving Surface  
  * Tracking on the Side of a Rotational Shaft
  
## Note
  * This board is equipped with the PAT9125EL-TKIT, which is an I2C connection type, and does not support SPI connection.
